Beckmann Spizzichino Model:

- Used to model the scattering of Terahertz (THz) waves from Gaussian surfaces under the assumption there is no multiple scattering.
- Calculates the mean scattered power from ideal scattered surface.

Code:

- Written in Jupyter Notebook to produce colour maps that portray the difference in the average power across all frequencies / angles measured in experiment.
- Takes time and the measured electric field from experimental data, Fourier transforms as a function of frequency, and plots onto a colour map.
